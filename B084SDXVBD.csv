How do I get my money back??  I would like to try this again but I need a refund on the bad film first ;(
1,Liliana,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHQGQ2KXTDQPMXTH2PQY3UZWCBFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,1.0,Es un Robo!,"En la descripción pone que incluye 2 unidades para unas 16 fotos, pero yo solo recibí 1 unidad para 8 foto. Es imposible contactar al vendedor y en las opciones de atención al cliente no provee para esto. O devuelvo la unidad que recibí a la espera que me envíen las 2 por las que pague o me quedo con la mitad de mi compra y pierdo mi tiempo y mi dinero. Es muy molesto está situación.La entrega tardó muchísimo y llega incompleto.Tenía un proyecto pendiente y con esto se me ha arruinado. Si decido quedarme con la mitad de mi pedido estaré pagando mas de $2.25 por cada foto, es un ""ROBO"".Por otra pare la fecha en el empaque decía Junio 2020 lo cual es bueno. Supongo que dado a que está en fecha debe ser de una calidad promedio.Esto es profundamente decepcionante. 😞"
2,Jay F.,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH6SIIA537Q5CYIOKXRYLLGGIIMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,1.0,But straight from Polaroid.com,"I got a polaroid I-type camera for my birthday (didn't come with film but that's okay) and bought this as soon as I realized it didn't come with film. Got it a day after my birthday, which was really awesome. However, the box that the film came in was covered in this weird glue-type goop that had hair and a bunch of debris stuck to it. Really disgusting. I put the film into my camera and took a photo only to realize that the film was also expired. Just order from polaroid themselves, it's not worth it."
3,Anh Minh Nguyen,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGVYXCQDZPMHCYL6WOC5BSSFB7FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,4.0,Should order from Polaroid website,"I got a Polaroid Now as a gift recently, so I can’t wait to take some pictures. My boyfriend bought the camera and a pack of film from the Polaroid website. The film pack came with it was recently produced, just a month away from the production date.I ordered my next pack of film right away from Amazon because of excitement. After seeing many reviews concerning about expired films, I got worried. The package arrived today, just in time for me to test it. I noticed that the production date is more than two months, older than what my boyfriend ordered from their website. The images came out great.Although the films are good, no concerns for now, moving forward I will order straight from their website to ensure the freshest patchs of exposure. Plus, they have a reward system so I can redeem coupons in the future."

I didn't even consider checking the expiration date because I used the packs 3 days after I received them, so I assumed they would not be anywhere close to expiring."
8,Graham,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF6FS4IVVWYGAKN7IIPY6RMCFQMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2.0,Defective batch,The last batch was defective. There were white striped patterns on every second picture and once two sheets came out and they were brown and black (s. The pics). I love polaroids but I want my money back for this purchase
9,Genevieve,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHFQKCDRXJXNQI4WQVC5BNCPQYBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,4.0,Expensive but I still enjoy it,"I wish they weren’t SO expensive. You have to use the entire thing, before switching. If you want to try a different color before it’s out, it will spit out one and waste it when you put it back in. A few of mine had discolored spots. Not to upset since it’s a vintage style picture anyways."
10,Catherine,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEJPC4QW22E3WIHDOKAZYGHNKZRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,1.0,DUD!,Both sets of film I ordered had issues in the camera. I have used other film in my camera and it worked just fine. These both got stuck so....I ended paying WAY to much for film that never provided one photo! No option to return either
11,barb,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEOYIDKDDANGMHQCZUXAZVZWO2BQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,3.0,"Dud photos, Yellow hue, Grainy quality","I bought two packs of these polaroid films, I bought them for my new polo roof lab that I had gotten for Christmas. I was super excited to use them; however, when I put them into my lab, One of the photos ejected when It wasn’t supposed to, and developed all wonky.  There were 4 other dud photos in one pack (which there is only 8). Film is super expensive so I was upset when I only got to use half of what I paid for. The other pack I had seemed to work fine but the image develops very yellow and grainy."

Unfortunately for some odd reason, BOTH packs of film had an issue with the 4th to the last photos. When the photo came out a second photo came out and both photos were ruined. Maybe a defect, but for both packs to mess up in the same spot is just sad."
13,Anjelica,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEYJDVLZK6KDKQ3RRPAPL3Q4NMUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,1.0,Expired film,The film was expired! It expired in October of 2020 when I only ordered it 2 days ago. I didn’t notice it till after I opened the boxes and used the film which is partially my fault for not noticing but also I’ve ordered the same brand of film from Amazon several times before and it’s never been expired. The pictures usually come out pretty good but in this case The photos were very warped in some places and overall the film had this yellow tinge to it. Needless to say I’m pretty disappointed with this. Next time please don’t send expired film it’s such a waste.
14,Tomas Cruz,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEIERESX4G3R2NMZQHFPZC745PJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,1.0,Very low quality pictures,"The pictures are very low quality, they do not look vintage, they look bad, there is no color on them, there are white and black spots all over the pictures, specially near the frame.I would not recommend buying this film."
15,J. Kruse,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHVITRMQ6OWB6D6VC4X5MWASSBJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5.0,Don’t buy here!,"This film is great, and you can get some really cool shots with it - however, you should buy it directly from Polaroid! Amazon sent me a pack that was months old, had not been stored properly, and the box looked like it had been smashed in transit (they packed it in a bubble envelope). This resulted in photos that came out washed out and did not develop evenly. Worst of all, a couple shots leaked chemicals all over the inside of the camera. So 5 stars for the film generally, zero stars for Amazon’s ability to properly sell it."
16,Steffany Ramirez,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH7AABDY7XPVAKTGXZD7AZ6W4NWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,3.0,More than half of the film was damaged,"I bought the 12 pack of color i-type film and was saddened to know that most of the film had splotches all over it, making most photos unrecognizable. I even noticed that sometimes 2 photos would come out at once, which is something I never experienced elsewhere. It's unfortunate because I purchased bulk so that I could use over time, so I wasn't able to return like typical items."

19,Amazon Customer,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH6WHH6HHP2OK36V5HZQIT7B5UVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2.0,Way Overpriced for a Dull Product,This film is incredibly overpriced for its lack of quality. I was used to the beautiful image of the Polaroid from my childhood. The photos now are dull in color. They have no contrast and the white balance is off. They lack any crisp definition. And they are incredibly overpriced. Even in bulk you are paying close to $2 per image and that’s too much. When you compare that to the cost of color film it just doesn’t work.The only this is you have no choice for compatibility for your Polaroid camera.
20,Bri Warriax,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGCKUZX5B3QETOPZRYLK7VC6TW5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5.0,Love it!,Defiantly will be buying more. The colors are so vibrant and beautiful

Threw them away after I went through 6 pictures that wouldn't come put correctly. Switched my film and it worked fine. What a waste of my $ and they won't refund me without the product? I threw the pictures away when I was upset that they didn't develop!
22,Gloria,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGN6JINKUPNFRSMYNHFTXAC7QOBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,3.0,Good film though,"There was a label said “not for individual sell” but they are def sold individually. I have nowhere to report this. It is more expensive than buying a combination ones on other place. The films works fine though, and they just need to be keep in the frige all the time until the 12h before you are going to use it."

I like the concept of a Polaroid more than the picture quality. Make sure you have good lighting and you hide it from light directly after and you get a good picture.
24,stretch,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AELTL4W446GPWQ3OUDOZ2CRL7MDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2.0,maybe my fault,"if you need 600 film , MAKE SURE , the camera does NOT need 600 PLUS film wasted all money for big shot camera and  I type film what i need to order is 600 plus all I can find is film  EXPIRED  1989"

Three photos came out defective in a single pack.  I looked at the production date and it says Feb 2020.  So I got film that was already 4 months old, and when I went to use it before the 12 month expiry date they were already defective.  I’m left with 3 more packs that expire in Feb 2021."

We used this to rise Polaroids at our destination wedding and it was perfect.

They really make the pictures pop. It comes out in a random order but I haven't found any colors I don't like. Worth the money.

However, I was upset that the packaging seemed like it was beaten down. I didn’t return it though because I needed to capture some memories for my daughter’s birthday. Some films has a bad print, I just kept the good ones."

As soon as I input it into the camera it wouldn't eject properly, I'm hoping it didn't mess my camera up.  I've shot about 5 packs with this camera so far, for the record."

The film didn’t turn out— note the tear in the top right corner. Also..the contrast quality was underwhelming. I would never buy this product again.

It's not like the film is cheap to buy! Amazon are good and always send me a replacement but it's just annoying it happens in the first place."

I was excited to start taking pictures until I realized the first four pictures came out of the camera on damaged film. There is another review that has pictures of spots where there is no image or film in that part of the picture, and that is how mine looks along with some white webbing. Very disappointed."

136,Mina,,4.0,Lo que aún no sabes del papel i-type,"Lo retro ha vuelto y parece que quiere quedarse. Después de muchos buscar y buscar información y diferencias entre el papel i-type y el Polaroid 600, no encuentro nada del otro mundo.La sensibilidad de estas casualmente está indicado en ASA que es lo mismo que ISO, nomenclaturas métricas de sensibilidad que son idénticas. Teniendo en cuenta que actualmente en las cámaras de super alta definición que cargan nuestros móviles este papel fotográfico tiene una sensibilidad/velocidad de 640 frente a la sensibilidad de 600 que tiene el papel Polaroid 600. La diferencia no es mucha, pero en las fotos se van a apreciar matices sutiles.Hay ciertas cosas que mi experiencia con las cámaras instantáneas me permite apuntillar:❌  Los cartuchos no se meten en el congelador, sino en el frigorífico. Lo pone indicado en las instrucciones pero están en inglés y pueden dar lugar a equivocación. La emulsión y la densidad del papel fotográfico se puede deteriorar y perder su funcionalidad si está a una temperatura por debajo de los 5°C. La temperatura recomendada es entre 5° y 10°, las que hay normalmente en un frigorífico convencional.❌ Las fotos NO se agitan. Eso es un mito y proviene de las primeras fotografías y antiguos métodos de impresión. Este nuevo modelo de papel i-type no necesita ser agitado como las maracas de Machín. Es más, si lo haces seguramente te cargues la foto.❌ No la perfores nunca jamás de los jamases. Ni la recortes. Aunque la foto esté hecha, no deja de ser un papel que ha reaccionado a ciertos químicos nosra poder tener impresa esa foto, cualquier tipo de malogro en el papel hará variar la fotografía. Pueden aparecer márgenes de color fucsia, se puede oscurecer ...❌ No la dejes al aire libre sin más. Aunque es un modelo nuevo de papel, tiene una metodología especial para ser revelado y las condiciones perfectas son a oscuras. Durante al menos 10 o 15 minutos. Exasperante lo sé, pero las prisas no son buenas consejeras. Hay mucha gente que se queja de la calidad de las fotos, que sale borrosa, arenosa, o sobrexpuesta dando por hecho que es una cámara como la que tiene el móvil en la que ves la foto al segundo. No, no es así. Muchas veces las fotos se echan a perder por desconocimiento. Es mejor echarla y muy rápidamente guardar la fotografía en el bolsillo trasero (pero acuérdate después de ella y no te vayas a sentar sobre ella más tarde) o guardarla en la mochila, en las páginas de un libro. Es como mejor va a salir❌ No esperes una foto FHD 4K. Será mejor que te mentalices con esto antes de echar una foto o antes de comprar la cámara para evitar disgustos. Las cámaras aunque sean modernas no dejan de ser analógicas, tienen lentes de otro tipo y la forma que tienen de absorber la luz es distinta por lo que no queda reflejado en el papel de forma tan fideligna. No te indignes si te pasa eso, es NORMAAAAL. Es uno de los rasgos más especiales de las cámaras como Polaroid y lomográficas y es que una foto no va a ser igual a la anterior, los filtros (no son filtros son efectos que ahora las apps tipo Instagram y Snapchat intentan reproducir y los llaman filtros) son únicos, no va a salir una foto igual a otra por más que lo intentes, los matices de colores son especiales y el toque retro vintage es genuino.✅ Vienen 8, no diez como en las Instax pero eso obedece a cuestiones de compatibilidad de cartuchos con las cámaras antiguas.✅ Se puede hacer fotos con doble exposición. Sí, has leído bien. Doble Exposición o lo que en la Lomo Bora Bora y en la Instax SQ20 llaman modo Bulb pero no es ni más ni menos que la unión de dos fotografías en un mismo papel, dos aperturas focales que se ""imprimen"" en la misma foto una sobre la otra. En este caso no se puede regular el tiempo de la apertura focal porque es automático pero sí que pueden salir fotos tipo lightpinting muy artísticas.✅ Tamaño: más grande que el tamaño Square de las Instax de Fujifilm. 10,7cm × 8,8cm contando con el marco. Es un tamaño que se presta mucho mucho MUCHO a unos mejores planos. Más detalle. Se pueden hacer selfies pero no al uso con la cámara porque tiene un objetivo que no enfoca a menos de 60cm por lo que es recomendable hacer fotos tipo retrato con un trípode.🙄Cosas en las que tiene que mejorar:🔹 Relación cantidad precio: la cámara ha perdido 2 fotos por cartucho, y aún así el precio de media por foto es de 2 euros en su precio habitual de venta. Afortunadamente he pillado una oferta y me ha salido a menos de 2 euros pero no mucho menos.🔹Acercarse a su competencia: sí bien es cierto que Polaroid y Fujifilm son competencia directa, los precios de esta última son más asequibles o al menos más ceñidos a lo que ofrecen. Yo no me lanzaría a comprarme una cámara de esta marca y sus cartuchos sin tener mucha idea de fotografía porque sería tirar el dinero y malgastar los cartuchos. 🔹Ojo con las fechas de caducidad. No aparece la fecha de caducidad al uso sino la fecha de producción y a partir de esa habría que contar con 12 meses de validez. Independientemente de que esté en la cámara metido el cartucho o en la caja sin usar. Se van a notar destellos en la imagen, puntos negros, y otro tipo de fallos si la película está pasada o fuera de fecha.🔹Ojo también con los rayos X, por si acaso. Las de Instax sí que reaccionan mal a los rayos X cuando pasan por los túneles de inspección en aeropuertos pero el embalaje está hecho para resistir los así que en caso de viaje es mejor llevar el cartucho sin poner o las fotos saldrán blancas.🔹Ojo con la luz. Las instrucciones son confusas te dicen que tengas el sol detrás para hacer las fotos pero no hace referencia a qué, si al objetivo o a ti mismo. Vale, re refiere a ti o a la cámara. Lo ideal para que las fotos salgan bien con la sensibilidad al máximo es tener el sol de espaldas y que el sujeto a fotografiar lo tenga de frente o como mucho de lado si quieres hacer un claroscuro. Pero NO que el sujeto tenga el sol detrás o la foto, repito, saldrá blanca."

138,Mina,,4.0,Papel B/W con el que hay que ir con ojo,"Lo primero, si tienes este cartucho, no lo abras estilo bestia y te deshagas del cartón que a simple vista parece inútil. Por dentro, si lo despegado con cuidado te vienen una serie de consejos muy útiles y necesarios si no eres un profesional de las cámaras Polaroid.Es importante puntualizar que este papel solo sirve para las Polaroid One Step (1, 2 Y Plus) y la Polaroid Now Y la Polaroid Lab DE AHORA, no las antiguas (que si aún no sabes cómo funciona, pásate por mi reseña para saberlo todo todito sobre esa nueva cámara)Es decir, si tienes una cámara Instax square y crees que este papel le sirve, no, no le sirve. Si tienes una Polaroid y has comprado papel cuadrado paranla instax de Fujifilm, tampoco sirve. Son cámaras distintas con procesos químicos distintos y los cartuchos no son compatibles.Hay que estar pendientes de la fecha de producción porque a partir de esa fecha la caducidad es aproximadamente de 12 meses dependiendo de las condiciones en las que lo tengamos.Si no lo vas a usar en un tiempo es mejor que lo tengas en el frigo, se mantendrán mejor. Si vas a viajar, no lo metas en la cámara ni lo abras antes de pasar por el escáner de rayos x o se velará y saldrá todo negro. Quizás con algo de amabilidad te dejen no pasar las cámaras por el escáner.Y ahora, las fotos. Si ya de por sí es complicado hacer una foto con una cámara Polaroid por varios motivos, el principal el precio, se le suma la sensibilidad de este papel. Es igual de sensible que el normal, tiene un ISO de 640 y aunque su velocidad de revelado es mayor, lo que pasa es que en este papel se agrava el contraste de blancos. Esto quiere decir que si la cámara tiene una sensibilidad media o alta pero no hay mucha luminosidad y el papel es en blanco y negro, saldrá oscura.Para que una foto con este papel salga muy muy bien tendría que ser con mucha luz, o natural o artificial, para que se vean más los contrastes de grises.El principal consejo es tener la fuente de iluminación detrás de nosotros como fotógrafos y de frente con respecto a la persona u objeto fotografiado. Si las condiciones climatológicas son buenas y no hay muchas nubes también admite una iluminación lateral y los retratos en blanco y negro saldrían como unos claroscuros muy bonitos y profesionales.Lo malo de estas fotos es que te lo tienes que pensar dos, tres y hasta cuatro veces antes de pulsar al obturador porque sale de media unos 2 euros por foto, ya que la caja tiene 8 fotos.Si se sabe usar bien tanto la cámara como el papel tienen un rendimiento bueno, es normal que si eres nuevo en el mundo de las cámaras instantáneas al principio te salgan fotos patata pero es normal. Puedes consultar mis comentarios anteriores sobre las que creo que son las mejores cámaras instantáneas del momento como la Instax Mini LiPlay y la SQ20 de Fujifilm o la Polaroid Now.¡Espero que sea útil mi comentario!"

Sad to loose money on this not cheap film because a description was not clear.WARNING FOR ALL LOOKING FOR FILM FOR THIER VINTAGE POLAROID!"
140,Jason Jenkins,,5.0,Daughter is happy,"Bought our daughter a new type I-Polaroid  for Christmas only to find out Christmas day that the tight gits never included a film! It cost enough, thought it would have had a film with it lol. Anyhow ordered through prime as soon as I could, price was reasonable and delivery exceptional as always with Prime."
141,Wank,,2.0,Very pricey & bad photo quality,"So expensive for just 8 shots! You have to be extremely still and if you take it in your house, you may aswell dump the shot because it seems like Polaroid only works in outside lighting. I wouldn't recommend Polaroid at all it's too expensive to take just 2 pictures: 2 picture are basically costing you €5. Just use your phone or by a disposable, honestly!"
142,OGFuriousR,,5.0,iType is True to colour,"As always, a little too pricey for a mere 8 photos but I always have fun with my polaroid. This lot seemed to be more true to colour than the 600 film which can be a little on the pink side and I really prefer the black frame its so much more aesthetic."

175,Client d'Amazon,,1.0,Très déçu,"Tres decu de ces films, j'effectue de nombreux polaroid, j'ai donc voulu tester les I type, les photos sortent toutes tres tres blanches, aucune couleur ne ressort, j'ai alors essayé dans d'autre polaroid pour voir si ce n'était pas le mien et il fait exactement pareil avec les autresJ'ai shooter avec un polaroid SLR et des films en 600 et non en I type la même photo avec les 2 polaroid et les photos sont complètement différentes, je suis donc decu de ce produit vu deja le prix excessif, la qualité devrait etre la, et 2eme point negatif la livraison, les polaroid sont arrivés dans un colis simple en carton et les polaroid nu a l'intérieur, l'emballage était enfoncé, abimé et déchiré, cela ne fais pas trés pro surtout quand vous voulez les offrir. Cela faisait plutôt films polaroid récupéré dans une poubelle"
176,Carolina,,5.0,Great!,Worked perfectly fine
177,Kindle Customer,,1.0,Waste of money,Not value for money.
178,Matteo,,5.0,Perfette!,"L'imballaggio è perfetto, i tempi di spedizione sono brevissimi, e comprando la confezione con 2 ricariche  (8 foto ×2) si risparmia un pochino, e considerando il prezzo standard dei film polaroid è un bene!Queste cartucce sono perfette per la polaroid 1step2, e per la 1step+!"
179,Rob Lionhart,,5.0,It worked well,It worked
180,Chandan,,1.0,Sehr teuer und schlechte Lieferung,"Ich habe eine Bestellung aufgegeben, damit ich den Film vor dem Wochenende erhalte, aber nach 4 Tagen der Bestellung sagen sie, dass das Produkt nicht von diesem Verkäufer verfügbar ist und ich erneut bestellen muss.Diese Filme sollen innerhalb eines Jahres nach der Herstellung verwendet werden. Die Filme, die ich bestellt habe, wurden im Mai hergestellt und sind bereits 6 Monate alt, also bleiben mir nur 6 Monate, um diese Filme zu verwenden.Polaroid sollte in Erwägung ziehen, den Preis für die Filme zu senken, da sie keine Batterie in sich tragen. Die Filme sind wirklich teuer und wenn man einen kleinen Fehler macht oder einen schlechten Filmsatz hat, hat man einen schlechten Tag."
181,alexis_lso,,5.0,Título incorrecto,El título dice 16 fotos pero en realidad son 8.Todo bien además de eso.
182,Marco (Dr.Stain3d),,4.0,"Buone le foto, a prescindere dalla confezione in cartone esterna","Le fotografie sono imballate bene ed arrivano sigillate, anche se non si può dore lo stesso della confezione in cartone esterna.Le foto vengono bene con polaroid ""one steap +"", buoni i colori e non hanno il difetto della striscia viola che ogni tanto capita.Consiglio"
183,Giovanni Barile,,2.0,Deluso,"Ho avuto un'esperienza non molto positiva con la Polaroid in generale. Mi hanno regalato una macchinetta a natale e tutte e 4 le foto che ho scattato con queste pellicole qui hanno dato dei problemi. Non so a cosa è dovuto, se alla macchinetta o alle pellicole o a qualche altra sorta di problema ma io ho letto tutte le istruzioni e sono sicuro di aver fatto tutto bene, sono anche molto pratico in queste cose, per cui sono rimasto parecchio allibito. Non credevo fosse cosí complicato scattare una buona istantanea, per di piú con quello che costano mi aspettavo tutt'altro..."
184,chi,,2.0,Non adatto a macchine anni 80,Non è  adatto a Polaroid 600 anni 80/90
185,Roberto,,5.0,Ok,Todo muy bien. Les diría que hagan caso omiso al comentario que hizo alguien anteriormente para que no se confundan porque la fecha que sale es la fecha de producción no la de vencimiento.
186,Yann p.,,4.0,Film instantané de bonne qualité,"Je vais essayer de vous donner mon avis le plus objectif possible. (La photo joint vous montre l'emballage d'une recharge film polaroid 6009 qui s'insère par l'avant de l'appareil)Pouvant réaliser 8 photos instantanées chacun soit 16 photos pour les deux recharges vendues ici, les films sont effectivement un peu chers. Effectivement les photos ressortent un peu blanches. Mais dans mes souvenirs d'enfance la qualité d'image des appareils photo de monsieur tout le monde était assez proche tout de même du rendu ici.Ainsi avec ces films vous retrouvez bien l'effet rétro d'époque. Selon moi, si vous cherchez un rendu à la qualité actuelle je ne pense pas que ces films et même les polaroids en général soient ce qu'il correspond le mieux.En revanche, si vous optez pour ces films, il ravira petits et grands, ami et famille, marquant instantanément vos moments magiques. J'ai pris l'habitude de conserver dans une boîte au moins une dizaine d'heures pour un résultat encore meilleur des photos. Il existe sans doute des films meilleurs mais globalement si vous aimez les photos rétro et que vous n'êtes pas très exigeant je vous conseille ces films qui feront l'affaire."
187,Cliente Amazon,,3.0,"Pellicole ottime, spedizione e imballaggio da dimenticare","Spedizione: nonostante l'acquisto fosse garantito con Prime la spedizione è arrivata in ritardo rispetto alla data garantita dal servizio e con la scatola che mostrava segni di pressioni.Imballaggio:  imbarazzante, le pellicole sono arrivate con la confezione schiacciata e rovinata dall'imballaggio troppo piccolo in cui sono state messe.La resa delle pellicole è stata tuttavia ottima; soltanto due si sono inceppate e sono andate perdute."
188,Daniela C.,,1.0,Un po’ delusa,"Prezzo standard. Non si riescono a trovare mai a prezzo minore. Un po’ rimasta male perché le ultime 4 foto sono uscite con una macchia in alto a destra, dalla prima che si notava un po’ di meno fino a rendere la macchia più evidente. Sinceramente una volta che spendo 16€ per 8 foto, vorrei che almeno la cartuccia sia perfetta !!!"
189,Antonio Ascione,,3.0,"Prezzo esagerato, ma buone","Il prezzo è veramente esagerato.30€ per 16 foto, che spesso con la Polaroid Lab vengono anche colorate male."
190,Dario,,3.0,Sì o no? Ni...,"Non lo so, c'è qualcosa che non mi convince (a partire dal prezzo, veramente troppo alto...).Una delle foto scattate, nonostante ormai sappiamo usare bene la macchina e non abbiamo mai avuto problemi, è stata stampata bruciata. Anche le altre non sono tanto di qualità (ma considerando la qualità delle stampe su altre cartucce direi che è quasi normale), ma pagare così tanto per poche foto e vederne una andare in fumo senza motivo dà un po' fastidio."
191,Andrea Guarino,,5.0,"Peccato il prezzo, però molte carine!",Premessa che difficilmente apprezzerete: il costo è alto. Ma per gli amanti della polaroid è un dato di fatto. Le pellicole sono molte carine perchè ricordano snoopy e la sua banda. Insomma mi piacciono un casino ed ora non vedo l’ora di provare quelle di topolino. Divertitevi come sempre
192,domenico,,3.0,Le sconsiglio,"Le ho comprate per il tema the mandalorian, curioso per i disegni sulle stampe ma ho notato fin dalla prima foto che la luminosità e la brillantezza è inferiore alle normali stampe. Leggendo altre recensione ho capito che non è solo un problema mio. Ho persino provato a fare foto identiche con la stessa luce usando due stampe diverse ed ho riscontrato questo problema. 3 stelle solo perché sono un grande fan di Star Wars e mi è piaciuta l'idea di inserire disegni sui bordi della stampa.P.s. Questo non significa che le foto sono da buttare."
193,Lucky61,,3.0,Il must delle pellicole istantanee,"Ho comprato poco tempo fa un pacco di iType per la mia polaroid One-Step 2 aspettando di usarla per poterle recensire. Il  prodotto è ottimo . L'illuminazione è fondamentale per la resa delle foto : con una luce media/alta  vengono nitide e con colori vividi. La spedizione è stata più che veloce, sono arrivate il giorno  dopo. Il costo è però abbastanza eccessivo."
194,Sheila O.,,5.0,Cuidado con las sub y exposiciones,"Tengo la Polaroid Lab y he usado este pack para eso. Algunas fotos salieron con tonos distintos; moradas, grises, naranjas... supongo que es parte del encanto. Pero hay que tener cuidado con las luces de la foto, pues muchas de ellas las tuve que repetir porque quedaban muy oscuras!"
195,78_bebe,,4.0,Informiert euch!,"Alle die hier schlechte Bilder als Ergebnis haben und 1 Stern vergeben sollten verstehen, dass das mit so vielen Faktoren zusammen hängt. Angefangen bei der Lagerung der Filme. Am besrek im Kühlschrank. Allein das beeinflusst das Ergebnis schon. Auch die Kamera Einstellungen zu kennen ist ein Punkt. Wenn man Helligkeit, Entfernung,... nicht beachtet bekommt man auch kein gutes Foto. Und so lange die gekauften Filme nicht abgelaufen sind kann der Hersteller da ja nichts dafür. Es geht hier um das Nötige Vorwissen wenn man eine Polaroid Kamera benutzt. Informieet euch. Es gibt genug Videos auf Youtube. Der einzige Nachteil ist einfach nur der Preis. Aber diese Filme sind nun mal teuer."
196,Nina Díaz Roura R.,,1.0,El título engaña,El título duce 16 fotos y en realidad solo es un paquete de 8. Cuidado.
197,Tetiana,,1.0,Terrible!,"I ordered a double pack and took one of the cassettes with me on vacation.  I was terribly upset when two photos got stuck in the camera and were ruined.  As a result, I had not 8 photos, but 5, since the third image was blown out due to the fact that I needed to get out two stuck photos. Other photos were ok."
198,giuseppe,,5.0,Proprio come le volevo,Arrivate in ottimo stato... Facilissimo da usare... Non sono scadute... (era una mia fobia) consigliatissimo
199,Bastilienchen,,5.0,Elegante Polaroids,"Dieser ""Film"" ist durch seine schwarze Farbe sehr elegant und macht die Bilder die entstehen zu etwas besonderem.Für diesen ""Spaß"" ist der Preis trotzdem relativ hoch."
200,Nibbler,,1.0,"Pessime, ha danneggiato il Lab","Davvero una delusione, prodotto scadente, di pessima qualità! Appena messe sul mio Polaroid Lab nuovo nuovo, dopo la prima foto è fuoriuscita della vernice bluastra che ha danneggiato il Lab.Una vergogna."
201,Markel,,4.0,Pack de 16 fotos (dos carretes),Dos pack a un precio un poco más ajustado que comprándolos por separado. Internamente se incluyen dos carretes de 8 fotos cada uno. Buena presentación. Se aconseja conservarlos en un ambiente frio.
202,Valentina N,,5.0,Ottimo acquisto,"Si sa, le pellicole per la polaroid sono costose. In questo pacco si “risparmia” un po’ in quanto sono 2 pacchetti da 8 pellicole (16 in totale). Spedizione velocissima, imballo non proprio consono in quanto sono arrivate in una busta e quindi la scatola si è schiacciata un po’. Nonostante questo sono perfettamente funzionanti e mi ritengo soddisfatta dell’acquisto!"
203,Daniele,,4.0,Ma quanto costa??!!!,"Adoro le foto Polaroid, super vintage. Ma non ha molto senso recensire questo prodotto in quanto è l'unico ad essere disponibile. Costa un botto e sto sempre con l'ansia di sbagliare scatto e quindi di buttare via la pellicola. Mi avevano detto che non era super economico ma la Polaroid original one step è sicuramente la più costosa!"
204,Japu,,5.0,Blaustich und Flecken,"16€ für die Mülltonne und das schon zum zweiten Mal. Beide Male waren Bilder einfach nur blaustichig mit Flecken in den Ecken. Dabei habe ich alles beachtet, lagern im Kühlschrank, bei Zimmertemperatur aufnehmen und in Ruhe ohne lichteinfall entwickeln lassen. Nicht ein Bild sieht - farbig-so aus wie die BSP Bilder.Habe auch verschiedene Belichtungseinstellungen genommen. Schade."
205,Wolf Müller-Funke,,5.0,Alte Farben wie früher,Ideal - das alte Format mit den blassen Farben
206,Alessio,,3.0,Costano troppo,Sono sempre belle le foto scattate con una polaroid.I colori e le ombre non aspettatevi che siano come immaginate. La stessa foto stampata 3 volte ha 3 sfumature diverse ed il bello il fascino è proprio quello secondo me.Costano l’occhio della testa.
207,LUCA,,5.0,Poco da dire,La qualità di Polaroid si conosce. Ho provato queste pellicole su consiglio di un amico fotografo.Il contrasto tra il nero della carta e la stampa in bianco e nero è stupendo.Ottima sia come idea regalo che per utilizzo professionale (mostre esposizioni ecc).
208,nino,,4.0,Pellicole in buono stato,"Ormai sono difficili da trovare nei negozi fisici, quindi già il solo fatto di poterle avere subito a casa è una grande comodità. Al di là di ciò le pellicole sono in ottimo stato, mi hanno quindi consentito di fare foto con la mia polaroid vintage."
209,Estefania Garza,,5.0,Todo excelente,"Nunca había usado pelicula blanco y negro en polaroid y resulto muy bien, lo interesante de la película es que no siempre salen con el mismo tono de blanco y negro, a veces se ven como más sepia entonces esta muy interesante usarlo, depende mucho de la luz donde tomes las fotos"
210,essedino,,3.0,"Polaroid, cosa ti aspetti?","Sì, sviluppa subito le foto, ma ormai, con il digitale, anche questa funzione è superata. Ho comprato queste carte fotografiche perché mi hanno dato una Polaroid da controllare e volevo vedere se funzionava. Sì, funziona, ma con tutti i suoi limiti."
211,Cristiano Carlon,,5.0,Attenti alle chimiche,"Le nuove chimiche 2020 risultano con colori più saturi e scuri: quindi occhio alle impostazioni! Le foto in pieno sole e senza flash verranno sensibilmente scure... tuttavia sempre bellissime!Il frame nero è un tocco di classe, non c'è che dire."
212,Sara,,1.0,:(,"Es mi primera polaroid, el último modelo. Estaba ilusionadisima con las primeras fotos. Y resulta que el papel está caducado y defectuoso... Quiero volver a comprarlo pero espero que esta vez me salga bueno.."

214,Romain,,4.0,Trop cher,"C'est super d'avoir ressuscité les instantané mais les consommable sont horriblement cher.Même ici dans un pack qui était ""une bonne affaire"" cela reste cher c'est pour dire..."
215,Amazon Kunde,,2.0,Bildqualität noch schlechter als damals,"Möglicherweise kaufen einige Leute ""Polaroid"" wegen des sogenannten Vintage-Looks.Tatsächlich unterscheiden sich die Bilder deutlich von dem, was man heute gewohnt ist.Ich möchte aber hinzufügen, selbst als die Sofortbildkameras eine aktuelle Technik waren, hätte man diese Bildqualität als schlecht empfunden. Inwieweit das am Film liegt oder an der Kamera kann ich schlecht einschätzen."
216,irenet,,1.0,No es compatible con la i1200,"Mi cámara ponía i1200 y  asumí que era iType, pero en realidad para Polaroid una cámara con menos de 10 años es vintage 🤷‍♀️.No me di cuenta hasta abrir el paquete. He visto algún vídeo online por el que se puede hacer un apaño para utilizar este carrete de esta en la mía, pero reutilizando un carrete apto para mi cámara... algo que desde hace unos meses ha dejado de fabricarse."
217,lorenzo,,1.0,Pellicola scaduta,Prodotto arrivato in ottime condizioni peccato che però è scaduto..me ne sono accorto quando ormai avevo già inserito la pellicola nella polaroid perciò non ho potuto procedere con il reso..

I would suggest sending the box of film in something more sturdier than a bubble wrapped envelope. Overall very impressed with this product and will be ordering again when my last pack of film is used!
247,Angela,,5.0,Imballo non idoneo,"Le pellicole arrivano nella confezione ""schiacciate"" per cui si inceppa la pellicola nella Polaroid (fotocamera). Mi è successo troppe volte per cui dovreste imballare meglio e non inserirle in un semplice cartone piatto... Va rivisto cortesemente l'imballo di spedizione. Grazie"
248,JG,,5.0,La mejor opción.,"Me resultó una gran oferta por 40 fotos. El precio es algo elevado, así lo son los repuestos i type film de Polaroid, sin embargo este paquete me resultó ""moderadamente barato""."
249,ananas,,2.0,très moyen,"Tout d’abord l’emballage du produit était abîmé, l’intérieur non et c’est le principal mais ça ne fait pas très professionnel. Ensuite le contour noir est bien noir donc conforme à la description, le point négatif est que la couleur des photos est très clair avec des reflets verts, donc très moche pour une photo souhaité en couleur normale. Je ne pourrai pas dire si cela vient de la qualité des films mais c’est très dommage car le prix est très élevé pour un pack de seulement 8 photos."
250,Giuliana Maggio,,3.0,Qualità OK - Tempi INACCETTABILI,"5 giorni di ritardo oltre i 18 previsti per la consegna sarebbero più che sufficienti per ottenere una pessima valutazione. A salvare la situazione, fortunatamente, interviene l'ottima qualità del prodotto.Prodotto consigliato ma tempi di consegna da rivedere completamente."
251,Marsela Kasa,,2.0,Dal fotografo costavano di meno!,Le pellicole sono buone però le ho trovate da un fotografo con il prezzo più ridotto!
252,Raffaella ,,3.0,Scadute ma non troppo male,"Le pellicole sono scadute (11/20), infatti dal primo scatto si può notare una sorta di macchia in basso sulla zampa e una sorta di striatura in alto,  in ogni caso poteva andare peggio. Nel complesso le foto non vengono male in ogni caso, spero che le successive non peggiorino."
253,Jose Ramirez Velez,,4.0,"Buen producto, pero algo caro","Producto esperado y en plazo, quizás precio elevado! Desde que Polaroid fue comprada no tiene nada que ver"
254,Saba Vittoria,,5.0,Sempre troppo costose,"Niente da dire, le pellicole ottime...Il prezzo eccessivo, spero di trovare un alternativa"
255,Maria A.,,1.0,Sehr enttäuschend,"Ich bin total unzufrieden und hätte auch gern Ersatz für die miese Qualität der Filme. Bei jedem 2. Bild gibt es einen Fehler. Entweder ist am unteren Bildrand die Farbe weg oder in der Mitte des Bildes sind Flecken. Die Filme sind echt teuer, dafür möchte man auch einwandfreie Bilder. Bin sehr enttäuscht!"

460,ワラッタ,,5.0,普通に良い,どこかの店で買ったi-タイプフィルムの限定バージョンは裂けたような模様が写り込む、左上に雪の結晶の模様が写り込む等で散々だった。カメラを買って最初にセットしたフィルムがそれだったのでカメラ本体に問題があるんじゃないかと心配したが、その後にこの商品をセットして使用したら何の問題もない写真が出来上がった。現像に問題が出るか否かはフィルム次第のようで、国内正規品だから問題が無いということなのかは不明。
461,Haga Tania Tomoko,,1.0,インスタントに不良品?,8枚つかって、8枚にトラブルがありました。写真の上左側に掛けてように見えます。もう1の箱は問題ありませんでした。写真の後ろにシアルナンバーは44116012086PRD 006018EAN 9120096770814
