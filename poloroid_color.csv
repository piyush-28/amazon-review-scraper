0,Anh Minh Nguyen,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGVYXCQDZPMHCYL6WOC5BSSFB7FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,4,Should order from Polaroid website,"I got a Polaroid Now as a gift recently, so I can’t wait to take some pictures. My boyfriend bought the camera and a pack of film from the Polaroid website. The film pack came with it was recently produced, just a month away from the production date.I ordered my next pack of film right away from Amazon because of excitement. After seeing many reviews concerning about expired films, I got worried. The package arrived today, just in time for me to test it. I noticed that the production date is more than two months, older than what my boyfriend ordered from their website. The images came out great.Although the films are good, no concerns for now, moving forward I will order straight from their website to ensure the freshest patchs of exposure. Plus, they have a reward system so I can redeem coupons in the future."
1,iris,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AESBHYKHYWURVEDCCMSE7ZQLT47A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5,Just as described !,Product just as described! 5 packs. They were protected very well for shipping. All the dates on the film were 2020 so that’s great!

3,Eleanor vasquez,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEMIJNRMCNNDNB7LEBZ4ONP573IA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5,Great quality.,Bought this along with the new Polaroid Now I-Type in green :) the film and picture quality is amazing and it’s great to know I’ll have pictures that will last and share with family and friends.
4,Genevieve,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHFQKCDRXJXNQI4WQVC5BNCPQYBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,4,Expensive but I still enjoy it,"I wish they weren’t SO expensive. You have to use the entire thing, before switching. If you want to try a different color before it’s out, it will spit out one and waste it when you put it back in. A few of mine had discolored spots. Not to upset since it’s a vintage style picture anyways."
5,J. Kruse,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHVITRMQ6OWB6D6VC4X5MWASSBJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5,Don’t buy here!,"This film is great, and you can get some really cool shots with it - however, you should buy it directly from Polaroid! Amazon sent me a pack that was months old, had not been stored properly, and the box looked like it had been smashed in transit (they packed it in a bubble envelope). This resulted in photos that came out washed out and did not develop evenly. Worst of all, a couple shots leaked chemicals all over the inside of the camera. So 5 stars for the film generally, zero stars for Amazon’s ability to properly sell it."

7,Danielle,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHYWD7GRS4ZBEQE4Q4PUJK5DKXSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,4,Good photo,Picture quality is good for a Polaroid. I like the concept of a Polaroid more than the picture quality. Make sure you have good lighting and you hide it from light directly after and you get a good picture.
8,Carla,https://amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEP3NSNH4ECVQ2TUGLAUX2YZKYGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5,Metallic color upgrade!,These are not cheap but the metallic color is such an upgrade from the typical plain white!

They really make the pictures pop. It comes out in a random order but I haven't found any colors I don't like. Worth the money.

However, I was upset that the packaging seemed like it was beaten down. I didn’t return it though because I needed to capture some memories for my daughter’s birthday. Some films has a bad print, I just kept the good ones."

77,Mina,,4,Lo que aún no sabes del papel i-type,"Lo retro ha vuelto y parece que quiere quedarse. Después de muchos buscar y buscar información y diferencias entre el papel i-type y el Polaroid 600, no encuentro nada del otro mundo.La sensibilidad de estas casualmente está indicado en ASA que es lo mismo que ISO, nomenclaturas métricas de sensibilidad que son idénticas. Teniendo en cuenta que actualmente en las cámaras de super alta definición que cargan nuestros móviles este papel fotográfico tiene una sensibilidad/velocidad de 640 frente a la sensibilidad de 600 que tiene el papel Polaroid 600. La diferencia no es mucha, pero en las fotos se van a apreciar matices sutiles.Hay ciertas cosas que mi experiencia con las cámaras instantáneas me permite apuntillar:❌  Los cartuchos no se meten en el congelador, sino en el frigorífico. Lo pone indicado en las instrucciones pero están en inglés y pueden dar lugar a equivocación. La emulsión y la densidad del papel fotográfico se puede deteriorar y perder su funcionalidad si está a una temperatura por debajo de los 5°C. La temperatura recomendada es entre 5° y 10°, las que hay normalmente en un frigorífico convencional.❌ Las fotos NO se agitan. Eso es un mito y proviene de las primeras fotografías y antiguos métodos de impresión. Este nuevo modelo de papel i-type no necesita ser agitado como las maracas de Machín. Es más, si lo haces seguramente te cargues la foto.❌ No la perfores nunca jamás de los jamases. Ni la recortes. Aunque la foto esté hecha, no deja de ser un papel que ha reaccionado a ciertos químicos nosra poder tener impresa esa foto, cualquier tipo de malogro en el papel hará variar la fotografía. Pueden aparecer márgenes de color fucsia, se puede oscurecer ...❌ No la dejes al aire libre sin más. Aunque es un modelo nuevo de papel, tiene una metodología especial para ser revelado y las condiciones perfectas son a oscuras. Durante al menos 10 o 15 minutos. Exasperante lo sé, pero las prisas no son buenas consejeras. Hay mucha gente que se queja de la calidad de las fotos, que sale borrosa, arenosa, o sobrexpuesta dando por hecho que es una cámara como la que tiene el móvil en la que ves la foto al segundo. No, no es así. Muchas veces las fotos se echan a perder por desconocimiento. Es mejor echarla y muy rápidamente guardar la fotografía en el bolsillo trasero (pero acuérdate después de ella y no te vayas a sentar sobre ella más tarde) o guardarla en la mochila, en las páginas de un libro. Es como mejor va a salir❌ No esperes una foto FHD 4K. Será mejor que te mentalices con esto antes de echar una foto o antes de comprar la cámara para evitar disgustos. Las cámaras aunque sean modernas no dejan de ser analógicas, tienen lentes de otro tipo y la forma que tienen de absorber la luz es distinta por lo que no queda reflejado en el papel de forma tan fideligna. No te indignes si te pasa eso, es NORMAAAAL. Es uno de los rasgos más especiales de las cámaras como Polaroid y lomográficas y es que una foto no va a ser igual a la anterior, los filtros (no son filtros son efectos que ahora las apps tipo Instagram y Snapchat intentan reproducir y los llaman filtros) son únicos, no va a salir una foto igual a otra por más que lo intentes, los matices de colores son especiales y el toque retro vintage es genuino.✅ Vienen 8, no diez como en las Instax pero eso obedece a cuestiones de compatibilidad de cartuchos con las cámaras antiguas.✅ Se puede hacer fotos con doble exposición. Sí, has leído bien. Doble Exposición o lo que en la Lomo Bora Bora y en la Instax SQ20 llaman modo Bulb pero no es ni más ni menos que la unión de dos fotografías en un mismo papel, dos aperturas focales que se ""imprimen"" en la misma foto una sobre la otra. En este caso no se puede regular el tiempo de la apertura focal porque es automático pero sí que pueden salir fotos tipo lightpinting muy artísticas.✅ Tamaño: más grande que el tamaño Square de las Instax de Fujifilm. 10,7cm × 8,8cm contando con el marco. Es un tamaño que se presta mucho mucho MUCHO a unos mejores planos. Más detalle. Se pueden hacer selfies pero no al uso con la cámara porque tiene un objetivo que no enfoca a menos de 60cm por lo que es recomendable hacer fotos tipo retrato con un trípode.🙄Cosas en las que tiene que mejorar:🔹 Relación cantidad precio: la cámara ha perdido 2 fotos por cartucho, y aún así el precio de media por foto es de 2 euros en su precio habitual de venta. Afortunadamente he pillado una oferta y me ha salido a menos de 2 euros pero no mucho menos.🔹Acercarse a su competencia: sí bien es cierto que Polaroid y Fujifilm son competencia directa, los precios de esta última son más asequibles o al menos más ceñidos a lo que ofrecen. Yo no me lanzaría a comprarme una cámara de esta marca y sus cartuchos sin tener mucha idea de fotografía porque sería tirar el dinero y malgastar los cartuchos. 🔹Ojo con las fechas de caducidad. No aparece la fecha de caducidad al uso sino la fecha de producción y a partir de esa habría que contar con 12 meses de validez. Independientemente de que esté en la cámara metido el cartucho o en la caja sin usar. Se van a notar destellos en la imagen, puntos negros, y otro tipo de fallos si la película está pasada o fuera de fecha.🔹Ojo también con los rayos X, por si acaso. Las de Instax sí que reaccionan mal a los rayos X cuando pasan por los túneles de inspección en aeropuertos pero el embalaje está hecho para resistir los así que en caso de viaje es mejor llevar el cartucho sin poner o las fotos saldrán blancas.🔹Ojo con la luz. Las instrucciones son confusas te dicen que tengas el sol detrás para hacer las fotos pero no hace referencia a qué, si al objetivo o a ti mismo. Vale, re refiere a ti o a la cámara. Lo ideal para que las fotos salgan bien con la sensibilidad al máximo es tener el sol de espaldas y que el sujeto a fotografiar lo tenga de frente o como mucho de lado si quieres hacer un claroscuro. Pero NO que el sujeto tenga el sol detrás o la foto, repito, saldrá blanca."
78,Mina,,4,Papel B/W con el que hay que ir con ojo,"Lo primero, si tienes este cartucho, no lo abras estilo bestia y te deshagas del cartón que a simple vista parece inútil. Por dentro, si lo despegado con cuidado te vienen una serie de consejos muy útiles y necesarios si no eres un profesional de las cámaras Polaroid.Es importante puntualizar que este papel solo sirve para las Polaroid One Step (1, 2 Y Plus) y la Polaroid Now Y la Polaroid Lab DE AHORA, no las antiguas (que si aún no sabes cómo funciona, pásate por mi reseña para saberlo todo todito sobre esa nueva cámara)Es decir, si tienes una cámara Instax square y crees que este papel le sirve, no, no le sirve. Si tienes una Polaroid y has comprado papel cuadrado paranla instax de Fujifilm, tampoco sirve. Son cámaras distintas con procesos químicos distintos y los cartuchos no son compatibles.Hay que estar pendientes de la fecha de producción porque a partir de esa fecha la caducidad es aproximadamente de 12 meses dependiendo de las condiciones en las que lo tengamos.Si no lo vas a usar en un tiempo es mejor que lo tengas en el frigo, se mantendrán mejor. Si vas a viajar, no lo metas en la cámara ni lo abras antes de pasar por el escáner de rayos x o se velará y saldrá todo negro. Quizás con algo de amabilidad te dejen no pasar las cámaras por el escáner.Y ahora, las fotos. Si ya de por sí es complicado hacer una foto con una cámara Polaroid por varios motivos, el principal el precio, se le suma la sensibilidad de este papel. Es igual de sensible que el normal, tiene un ISO de 640 y aunque su velocidad de revelado es mayor, lo que pasa es que en este papel se agrava el contraste de blancos. Esto quiere decir que si la cámara tiene una sensibilidad media o alta pero no hay mucha luminosidad y el papel es en blanco y negro, saldrá oscura.Para que una foto con este papel salga muy muy bien tendría que ser con mucha luz, o natural o artificial, para que se vean más los contrastes de grises.El principal consejo es tener la fuente de iluminación detrás de nosotros como fotógrafos y de frente con respecto a la persona u objeto fotografiado. Si las condiciones climatológicas son buenas y no hay muchas nubes también admite una iluminación lateral y los retratos en blanco y negro saldrían como unos claroscuros muy bonitos y profesionales.Lo malo de estas fotos es que te lo tienes que pensar dos, tres y hasta cuatro veces antes de pulsar al obturador porque sale de media unos 2 euros por foto, ya que la caja tiene 8 fotos.Si se sabe usar bien tanto la cámara como el papel tienen un rendimiento bueno, es normal que si eres nuevo en el mundo de las cámaras instantáneas al principio te salgan fotos patata pero es normal. Puedes consultar mis comentarios anteriores sobre las que creo que son las mejores cámaras instantáneas del momento como la Instax Mini LiPlay y la SQ20 de Fujifilm o la Polaroid Now.¡Espero que sea útil mi comentario!"
79,Jason Jenkins,,5,Daughter is happy,"Bought our daughter a new type I-Polaroid  for Christmas only to find out Christmas day that the tight gits never included a film! It cost enough, thought it would have had a film with it lol. Anyhow ordered through prime as soon as I could, price was reasonable and delivery exceptional as always with Prime."
80,OGFuriousR,,5,iType is True to colour,"As always, a little too pricey for a mere 8 photos but I always have fun with my polaroid. This lot seemed to be more true to colour than the 600 film which can be a little on the pink side and I really prefer the black frame its so much more aesthetic."
81,Maria Elisa Moreira,,5,Amazing,Amazing
82,Kindle Customer,,5,Perfect for OneStep cameras,"Works perfectly with Polaroid's OneStep cameras. Pack of 8, arrived very swiftly."

91,Douglas Wright,,5,Great,Only eight shots in a pack but that’s the choice you make when you get a Polaroid camera.
92,xxxxx,,5,Don’t buy if you have the vintage Polaroid cameras because you can’t use it,I’m a fool who didn’t read it! But just so no one else makes the same mistake! Please don’t buy it if you have the vintage Polaroid cameras!! It doesn’t fit in the camera! They are not compatible!

107,Roberto,,5,Ok,Todo muy bien. Les diría que hagan caso omiso al comentario que hizo alguien anteriormente para que no se confundan porque la fecha que sale es la fecha de producción no la de vencimiento.
108,Yann p.,,4,Film instantané de bonne qualité,"Je vais essayer de vous donner mon avis le plus objectif possible. (La photo joint vous montre l'emballage d'une recharge film polaroid 6009 qui s'insère par l'avant de l'appareil)Pouvant réaliser 8 photos instantanées chacun soit 16 photos pour les deux recharges vendues ici, les films sont effectivement un peu chers. Effectivement les photos ressortent un peu blanches. Mais dans mes souvenirs d'enfance la qualité d'image des appareils photo de monsieur tout le monde était assez proche tout de même du rendu ici.Ainsi avec ces films vous retrouvez bien l'effet rétro d'époque. Selon moi, si vous cherchez un rendu à la qualité actuelle je ne pense pas que ces films et même les polaroids en général soient ce qu'il correspond le mieux.En revanche, si vous optez pour ces films, il ravira petits et grands, ami et famille, marquant instantanément vos moments magiques. J'ai pris l'habitude de conserver dans une boîte au moins une dizaine d'heures pour un résultat encore meilleur des photos. Il existe sans doute des films meilleurs mais globalement si vous aimez les photos rétro et que vous n'êtes pas très exigeant je vous conseille ces films qui feront l'affaire."
109,Andrea Guarino,,5,"Peccato il prezzo, però molte carine!",Premessa che difficilmente apprezzerete: il costo è alto. Ma per gli amanti della polaroid è un dato di fatto. Le pellicole sono molte carine perchè ricordano snoopy e la sua banda. Insomma mi piacciono un casino ed ora non vedo l’ora di provare quelle di topolino. Divertitevi come sempre
110,Sheila O.,,5,Cuidado con las sub y exposiciones,"Tengo la Polaroid Lab y he usado este pack para eso. Algunas fotos salieron con tonos distintos; moradas, grises, naranjas... supongo que es parte del encanto. Pero hay que tener cuidado con las luces de la foto, pues muchas de ellas las tuve que repetir porque quedaban muy oscuras!"
111,78_bebe,,4,Informiert euch!,"Alle die hier schlechte Bilder als Ergebnis haben und 1 Stern vergeben sollten verstehen, dass das mit so vielen Faktoren zusammen hängt. Angefangen bei der Lagerung der Filme. Am besrek im Kühlschrank. Allein das beeinflusst das Ergebnis schon. Auch die Kamera Einstellungen zu kennen ist ein Punkt. Wenn man Helligkeit, Entfernung,... nicht beachtet bekommt man auch kein gutes Foto. Und so lange die gekauften Filme nicht abgelaufen sind kann der Hersteller da ja nichts dafür. Es geht hier um das Nötige Vorwissen wenn man eine Polaroid Kamera benutzt. Informieet euch. Es gibt genug Videos auf Youtube. Der einzige Nachteil ist einfach nur der Preis. Aber diese Filme sind nun mal teuer."
112,giuseppe,,5,Proprio come le volevo,Arrivate in ottimo stato... Facilissimo da usare... Non sono scadute... (era una mia fobia) consigliatissimo
113,Bastilienchen,,5,Elegante Polaroids,"Dieser ""Film"" ist durch seine schwarze Farbe sehr elegant und macht die Bilder die entstehen zu etwas besonderem.Für diesen ""Spaß"" ist der Preis trotzdem relativ hoch."
114,Markel,,4,Pack de 16 fotos (dos carretes),Dos pack a un precio un poco más ajustado que comprándolos por separado. Internamente se incluyen dos carretes de 8 fotos cada uno. Buena presentación. Se aconseja conservarlos en un ambiente frio.
115,Valentina N,,5,Ottimo acquisto,"Si sa, le pellicole per la polaroid sono costose. In questo pacco si “risparmia” un po’ in quanto sono 2 pacchetti da 8 pellicole (16 in totale). Spedizione velocissima, imballo non proprio consono in quanto sono arrivate in una busta e quindi la scatola si è schiacciata un po’. Nonostante questo sono perfettamente funzionanti e mi ritengo soddisfatta dell’acquisto!"
116,Daniele,,4,Ma quanto costa??!!!,"Adoro le foto Polaroid, super vintage. Ma non ha molto senso recensire questo prodotto in quanto è l'unico ad essere disponibile. Costa un botto e sto sempre con l'ansia di sbagliare scatto e quindi di buttare via la pellicola. Mi avevano detto che non era super economico ma la Polaroid original one step è sicuramente la più costosa!"
117,Japu,,5,Blaustich und Flecken,"16€ für die Mülltonne und das schon zum zweiten Mal. Beide Male waren Bilder einfach nur blaustichig mit Flecken in den Ecken. Dabei habe ich alles beachtet, lagern im Kühlschrank, bei Zimmertemperatur aufnehmen und in Ruhe ohne lichteinfall entwickeln lassen. Nicht ein Bild sieht - farbig-so aus wie die BSP Bilder.Habe auch verschiedene Belichtungseinstellungen genommen. Schade."
118,LUCA,,5,Poco da dire,La qualità di Polaroid si conosce. Ho provato queste pellicole su consiglio di un amico fotografo.Il contrasto tra il nero della carta e la stampa in bianco e nero è stupendo.Ottima sia come idea regalo che per utilizzo professionale (mostre esposizioni ecc).
119,nino,,4,Pellicole in buono stato,"Ormai sono difficili da trovare nei negozi fisici, quindi già il solo fatto di poterle avere subito a casa è una grande comodità. Al di là di ciò le pellicole sono in ottimo stato, mi hanno quindi consentito di fare foto con la mia polaroid vintage."
120,Estefania Garza,,5,Todo excelente,"Nunca había usado pelicula blanco y negro en polaroid y resulto muy bien, lo interesante de la película es que no siempre salen con el mismo tono de blanco y negro, a veces se ven como más sepia entonces esta muy interesante usarlo, depende mucho de la luz donde tomes las fotos"
121,Cristiano Carlon,,5,Attenti alle chimiche,"Le nuove chimiche 2020 risultano con colori più saturi e scuri: quindi occhio alle impostazioni! Le foto in pieno sole e senza flash verranno sensibilmente scure... tuttavia sempre bellissime!Il frame nero è un tocco di classe, non c'è che dire."
122,NiA,,4,Prima,"Prima- etwas teuer, aber das war Polaroid schon immer.Nostalgie pur!"
123,Romain,,4,Trop cher,"C'est super d'avoir ressuscité les instantané mais les consommable sont horriblement cher.Même ici dans un pack qui était ""une bonne affaire"" cela reste cher c'est pour dire..."

129,Luis,,4,Foto bellissime ma troppo costose,non capisco perche il bianco nero costa piu del colore e perche comprando pacchi con piu rullini invece di risparmiare costano di piu ......foto bellissima ma comunque costano troppo

145,Jennifer T.,,5,Great product for a great price!,Great quality. Box came a little damaged but did not affect the film whatsoever.

146,Angela,,5,Imballo non idoneo,"Le pellicole arrivano nella confezione ""schiacciate"" per cui si inceppa la pellicola nella Polaroid (fotocamera).
